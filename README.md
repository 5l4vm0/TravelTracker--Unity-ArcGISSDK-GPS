## :bulb: Project Overview
This is a Unity-based mobile application that allows users to track and visualize their travel history in real-time using GPS data. It's perfect for travel enthusiasts who want to create a visual trail of all the places they've explored, even without an internet connection. By leveraging the ArcGIS SDK for Unity, this app integrates real-time GPS tracking, dynamic map updates, and interactive visualisation to provide a comprehensive travel experience. The app works offline, allowing users to continue tracking their location without WiFi or mobile data, and includes a persistent save system to store location data.
This project showcases the combination of GIS technology with real-time user interactivity on Android devices.
